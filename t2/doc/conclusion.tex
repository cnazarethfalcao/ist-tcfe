\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing an RC circuit was achieved. Theoretical calculations were made following the different tasks proposed. Then, a simulation of the given circuit was produced and the results were perfectly similar to the previously calculated values.
One reason for these satisfactory results is the fact that this circuit containes only one capacitor and linear components and so it was expected that the results would not differ.
