\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a circuit was achieved. Theoretical calculations were made using both mesh and node methods. Then, a simulation of the given circuit was produced and the results were perfectly similar to the previously calculated values.
One reason for these satisfactory results is the fact that this circuit containes only linear components and so it was expected that the results would not differ.
In resume, the reliability of these methods was proven, since we obtained relative errors with a maximum order of magnitude equal to (-4). Since the results were very precise, one deduces the methods can be used in order to help analysing circuits.
